Â # Development Priorities & Time Allocation

     ## Time Allocation Framework (15-20 hrs/week)

     ### Monthly Sprint Model
     - **Weeks 1-3**: 70% Soccer (12 hrs), 30% Planner (6 hrs)
     - **Week 4**: 30% Soccer (6 hrs), 70% Planner (12 hrs)

     ### Why This Works
     1. Deep focus blocks for complex features
     2. Natural project switching prevents burnout
     3. Aligns with B2B (soccer) vs B2C (planner) rhythms
     4. Monthly planner sprint maintains momentum

     ## Phase-Based Priority Shifts

     ### Phase 1: Foundation (Aug-Oct 2025)
     **Soccer**: 70% | **Planner**: 30%
     - Soccer: Critical infrastructure, data pipeline
     - Planner: Algorithm design, beta testing

     ### Phase 2: Pilot Prep (Nov 2025-Jan 2026)
     **Soccer**: 85% | **Planner**: 15%
     - Soccer: MUST hit Spring pilot deadline
     - Planner: Maintenance mode only

     ### Phase 3: Pilot Season (Feb-May 2026)
     **Soccer**: 90% | **Planner**: 10%
     - Soccer: Active coach support critical
     - Planner: Bug fixes, data collection

     ### Phase 4: Summer Sprint (Jun-Aug 2026)
     **Soccer**: 50% | **Planner**: 50%
     - Soccer: Off-season improvements
     - Planner: Major feature push

     ### Phase 5: Scale (Sep 2026-Feb 2027)
     **Soccer**: 60% | **Planner**: 40%
     - Soccer: NWSL preparation
     - Planner: Growth optimization

     ## Critical Path Items

     ### Soccer App Non-Negotiables
     1. **PostgreSQL schema** - Week 1
     2. **Polar CSV parser** - Week 2
     3. **Basic readiness scoring** - Week 3
     4. **Coach dashboard MVP** - Week 4
     5. **University outreach** - October
     6. **Pilot onboarding** - January

     ### Planner App Essentials
     1. **Core algorithm** - Week 1
     2. **User preference capture** - Week 2
     3. **Streak tracking** - Week 3
     4. **Mobile-friendly UI** - Week 4
     5. **Beta user feedback** - Ongoing
     6. **Paid tier launch** - May 2026

     ## Shared Infrastructure Priorities

     ### Must Build Once (Benefits Both)
     1. **User authentication** (JWT-based)
     2. **PostgreSQL setup** (shared instance)
     3. **FastAPI base** (common middleware)
     4. **Error tracking** (Sentry integration)
     5. **Deployment pipeline** (GitHub Actions)

     ### Can Share Later
     1. **React components** (after MVP phase)
     2. **Analytics engine** (pattern detection)
     3. **Notification system** (email/push)
     4. **Payment processing** (Stripe)

     ## Decision Framework

     ### When to Prioritize Soccer
     - Approaching university deadlines
     - Pilot team needs support
     - Conference/demo approaching
     - NWSL conversations active

     ### When to Prioritize Planner
     - Soccer in off-season lull
     - Waiting for coach feedback
     - Need motivation boost (B2C faster feedback)
     - Testing shared infrastructure

     ## Risk Management

     ### If Behind Schedule on Soccer
     1. Pause planner completely (0 hours)
     2. Consider $3K contractor for UI work
     3. Take PTO for sprint week
     4. Scope down to 3 core features

     ### If Behind Schedule on Planner
     1. Delay launch by 2-3 months (flexible)
     2. Launch with fewer features
     3. Focus on core loop only
     4. Skip advanced analytics initially

     ## Weekly Standup Questions

     Every Sunday, ask yourself:
     1. What's the #1 risk to Spring pilots?
     2. Are planner beta users still engaged?
     3. What can I build once for both apps?
     4. Where am I blocked or frustrated?
     5. What would make next week easier?

     ## Success Metrics

     ### Soccer App (Primary)
     - Week 4: MVP with real data flowing
     - Month 3: 2 universities interested
     - Month 6: 3 teams in active pilot
     - Month 12: 10 paying teams

     ### Planner App (Secondary)
     - Week 4: 10 beta users testing
     - Month 3: 50% day-7 retention
     - Month 6: 100 paying users
     - Month 12: 1000 paying users

     ## The Golden Rule

     **Soccer app deadlines are fixed** (NCAA seasons don't move)
     **Planner app deadlines are flexible** (consumers always there)

     When in doubt, choose the soccer app. It has:
     - Higher revenue per customer
     - Better exit multiples
     - Clearer path to profitability
     - Less competition in the niche
