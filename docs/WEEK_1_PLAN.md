## üöÄ Key Deliverables

### Code Deliverables
1. **auth.py**: Production-ready JWT authentication
2. **polar_parser.py**: Robust CSV ingestion service  
3. **readiness_calculator.py**: Core scoring algorithm
4. **Updated routes**: Secured with proper access control

### Documentation Deliverables
1. API endpoint documentation
2. Architecture decision records (ADRs)
3. Week 2 development plan
4. Updated README with setup instructions

### Infrastructure Deliverables
1. Updated requirements.txt with new dependencies
2. .env.example file for configuration
3. Docker-compose for local development
4. Basic CI/CD GitHub Action

## üìö Learning Resources

### Priority Reading (15-30 min each)
1. **FastAPI Security**: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/
2. **ACWR in Sports**: https://www.scienceforsport.com/acwr/
3. **12 Factor App**: https://12factor.net/ (focus on Config, Dependencies)

### Optional Deep Dives
- JWT Best Practices: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8725
- Pandas Performance: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/enhancingperf.html
- SQLAlchemy Patterns: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/session_basics.html

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Polar CSV format changes**: Build flexible parser with field mapping
2. **Performance at scale**: Design with caching from day 1
3. **Data loss**: Implement comprehensive logging and backup

### Business Risks
1. **Scope creep**: Strictly follow 70/30 split (soccer/planner)
2. **Time management**: Use Pomodoro technique for focused sessions
3. **Feature requests**: Document but defer non-MVP features

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] 0 security vulnerabilities in code
- [ ] 100% of endpoints authenticated
- [ ] <200ms readiness calculation time
- [ ] 50%+ test coverage on core modules

### Qualitative
- [ ] Clean, documented code ready for handoff
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Intuitive API design
- [ ] Comprehensive error messages

## üí° Architecture Decisions Made

### ADR-001: JWT over Session Auth
**Decision**: Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication
**Rationale**: 
- Scales horizontally without session storage
- Works well with B2B model (each org can validate)
- Simpler infrastructure requirements

### ADR-002: Pandas for CSV Processing
**Decision**: Use pandas instead of csv module
**Rationale**:
- Built-in data type inference
- Powerful data transformation capabilities
- Industry standard for data processing

### ADR-003: Service Layer Pattern
**Decision**: Separate business logic into service classes
**Rationale**:
- Testable in isolation
- Reusable across endpoints
- Clear separation of concerns

## üîÑ Daily Standup Questions

Each day, answer:
1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. What blockers do I have?
4. What did I learn?

## üìù End of Week Reflection

To be completed Friday evening:
- [ ] What went better than expected?
- [ ] What took longer than planned?
- [ ] What patterns emerged?
- [ ] What should we do differently next week?
